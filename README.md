Here is a README.md file for the Selenium-Cucumber-JUnit-Serenity Java project:

# Selenium-Cucumber-JUnit-Serenity

This is a sample project to demonstrate Selenium, Cucumber, JUnit, and Serenity BDD for Java test automation.

## About

This project uses:

- Selenium for browser automation
- Cucumber for BDD style test execution
- JUnit for assertions
- Serenity for test reports and output

Tests are written in Cucumber feature files located in `src/test/resources/features`. Step definitions binding the tests to Selenium code are in `src/test/java`.

## Running Tests

To run the full test suite:

```
mvn clean verify
```

This will execute the tests and generate a Serenity test report in `target/site/serenity`.

To run a specific feature file:

```
mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.options="src/test/resources/features/login.feature"
```

## Reports

The Serenity report will be generated at `target/site/serenity/index.html` after a test run.

## Requirements

- Java 1.8+
- Maven

## Key Files

**pom.xml** - Maven dependencies and plugins

**src/test/java** - Step definitions 

**src/test/resources/features** - Cucumber feature files

## Configuration

Update the Serenity and Cucumber versions in `pom.xml` as needed.

## Credits

This project serves as a simple example only to demonstrate Selenium, Cucumber, JUnit, and Serenity BDD together in Java.
